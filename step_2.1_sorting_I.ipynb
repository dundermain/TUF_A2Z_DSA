    "The algorithm steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. First, we will select the range of the unsorted array using a loop (say i) that indicates the starting index of the range.\n",
    "    2. The loop will run forward from 0 to n-1. The value i = 0 means the range is from 0 to n-1, and similarly, i = 1 means the range is from 1 to n-1, and so on. (Initially, the range will be the whole array starting from the first index.)\n",
    "    3. Now, in each iteration, we will select the minimum element from the range of the unsorted array using an inner loop.\n",
    "    4. After that, we will swap the minimum element with the first element of the selected range(in step 1). \n",
    "    5. Finally, after each iteration, we will find that the array is sorted up to the first index of the range. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Here, after each iteration, the array becomes sorted up to the first index of the range. That is why the starting index of the range increases by 1 after each iteration. This increment is achieved by the outer loop and the starting index is represented by variable i in the following code. And the inner loop(i.e. j) helps to find the minimum element of the range [i…..n-1].\n",

    "\n",
    "Time complexity: O(N2), (where N = size of the array), for the best, worst, and average cases.\n",
    "Reason: If we carefully observe, we can notice that the outer loop, say i, is running from 0 to n-2 i.e. n-1 times, and for each i, the inner loop j runs from i to n-1. For, i = 0, the inner loop runs n-1 times, for i = 1, the inner loop runs n-2 times, and so on. So, the total steps will be approximately the following: (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ……..+ 3 + 2 + 1. The summation is approximately the sum of the first n natural numbers i.e. (n*(n+1))/2. The precise time complexity will be O(n2/2 + n/2). Previously, we have learned that we can ignore the lower values as well as the constant coefficients. So, the time complexity is O(n2). Here the value of n is N i.e. the size of the array."
