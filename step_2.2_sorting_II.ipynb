    "    We will be creating 2 functions mergeSort() and merge().\n",
    "    mergeSort(arr[], low, high):\n",
    "        1. In order to implement merge sort we need to first divide the given array into two halves. Now, if we carefully observe, we need not divide the array and create a separate array, but we will divide the arrayâ€™s range into halves every time. For example, the given range of the array is 0 to 4(0-based indexing). Now on the first go, we will divide the range into half like (0+4)/2 = 2. So, the range of the left half will be 0 to 2 and for the right half, the range will be 3 to 4. Similarly, if the given range is low to high, the range for the two halves will be low to mid and mid+1 to high, where mid = (low+high)/2. This process will continue until the range size becomes.\n",
    "        2. So, in mergeSort(), we will divide the array around the middle index(rather than creating a separate array) by making the recursive call :\n",
    "            1. mergeSort(arr,low,mid)   [Left half of the array]\n",
    "            2. mergeSort(arr,mid+1,high)  [Right half of the array]\n",
    "        where low = leftmost index of the array, high = rightmost index of the array, and mid = middle index of the array.\n",
    "        3. Now, in order to complete the recursive function, we need to write the base case as well. We know from step 2.1, that our recursion ends when the array has only 1 element left. So, the leftmost index, low, and the rightmost index high become the same as they are pointing to a single element.\n",
    "        Base Case: if(low >= high) return;"
